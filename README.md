</br>This folder contains two folders which include the following files:
</br>1)	Assembler.c
</br>	Our C code which converts assembly language into its equivalent binary representation.
</br>
</br>
</br>2)	Output.c
</br>	Our C code which converts binary code to final output of the program.
</br>
</br>
</br>3)	Instructions.txt
</br>	Contains all the opcodes along with its corresponding binary representation.
</br>
</br>
</br>4)	Register.txt
</br>	Contains all the registers defined along with its corresponding binary representation.
</br>
</br>
</br>5)	code.txt
</br>	Contains the assembly language code.
</br>
</br>
</br>Output Files generated:
</br>1)	sym.txt
</br>	Contains all the labels along with its corresponding line numbers.
</br>
</br>
</br>2)	bin.txt
</br>	Contains binary conversion of our assembly code.
</br>
</br>
</br>3)	out.txt
</br>	Contains the final output of our program.
</br>
</br>
</br>4)	flow_of_control.txt
</br>	contains the complete flow of control which contains line executed along with the register values and various flag registers and program counter.
</br>
</br>
</br>Instructions:
</br>1)	Run Assembler.c in each folder to create corresponding output files for each assembly code.
</br>2)	Run Output.c in each folder after executing Assembler.c to create corresponding output files for each binary code.
